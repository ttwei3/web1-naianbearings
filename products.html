                        <h2>Tapered Roller Bearing</h2>
                        <p>Naian tapered roller bearings are
                            designed to meet and exceed the quality
                            and performance requirements of
                            applications where there are heavy
                            combined loads and tilting moments.
                            The logarithmic profile of the rollers
                            provides superior load distribution. The
                            design of the flange/roller-end contact
                            area reduces edge loading and promotes the formation of a lubricant film
                            even under arduous operating
                             conditions. The optimized finish of all
                            contact surfaces maximizes the effectiveness of the lubricant. These features
                            significantly decrease noise, temperature and vibration levels, and virtually
                            eliminate temperature peaks during a
                            typical start-up period.
                            Naian tapered roller bearings
                            are proven to increase uptime, while
                            decreasing maintenance and operating
                            costs.

                        <h2>Thrust Balling Bearing</h2>
                        <p>Single and double direction thrust ball bearings are used to accommodate
                            pure axial loads, mostly in low-speed applications. Though their design is
                            rather simple, these robust bearings can provide long, trouble-free service
                            life. All Naian thrust ball bearings are produced to the same high quality
                            standards in order to fulfil the requirements of the application.
                            Thrust ball bearings are separable so that mounting is simple as the
                            shaft and housing washers can be mounted separately. Depending on the
                            bearing series and size, Naian thrust ball bearings are fitted with either
                            pressed steel, machined brass or machined steel cages.

                        <h2>Spherical Plain Bearings</h2>
                    <p>Spherical Plain Bearings, also known as spherical plain or plain spherical bearings, are essential components in mechanical systems that require pivotal movement along non-rotating axes. These bearings facilitate smooth and controlled motion in applications where angular misalignment, tilting, or oscillating movement is essential. With their self-lubricating design, Spherical Plain Bearings minimize friction and wear, contributing to prolonged equipment life and reduced maintenance requirements.
                        At Naian Bearing, our Spherical Plain Bearings are engineered to precision, adhering to international quality standards. Our commitment to excellence is reflected in the design, manufacturing processes, and materials used in crafting these bearings.

                        <h2>Steel Plain Bearing</h2>
                        <p>Naian steel/steel plain bearings
                            are initially lubricated and sealed to
                            eliminate the need for relubrication in
                            applications with low to moderate levels
                            of contamination, such as those in
                            off-highway applications. This generates
                            significant savings by reducing maintenance costs and grease consumption.
                            These virtually maintenance-free
                            bearings also improve reliability by
                            eliminating failures due to missed
                            lubrication intervals and improper
                            lubrication practices. All of this adds up
                            to reduced Total Cost of Ownership
                            (TCO).
                            The extensive laboratory and field tests
                            showed that the relubrication-free Naian steel/steel plain bearings last
                            significantly longer than the conventional bearings, even when they were
                            frequently relubricated.
